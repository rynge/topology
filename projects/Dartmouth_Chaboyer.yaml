Description: >
  Computational stellar models are widely used in astrophysics and are
  often consulted to interpret observations of starlight. My research
  group aims to improve stellar models by incorporating updated physics
  into the models, creating a database of stellar models for use by other
  researchers, and to use these improved stellar models to study a variety
  of issues related to galactic archelogy and the formation of galaxies.
